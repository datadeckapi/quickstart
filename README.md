# Datadeck Quickstart

Welcome to [Deck](https://deck.co)'s Quickstart! This repo contains three folders: **dotnet/**, **nodejs/** and **python/**. Each folder contains a minimal full-stack app that implements support end-to-end for one Datadeck product endpoint.

To get started, clone the repository, `cd` into one of the folders, and follow the instructions in the corresponding **README**. Enjoy! 

```
git clone https://github.com/datadeckapi/quickstart.git && cd ./quickstart
```

If you're looking for a more fully-featured quickstart, covering more API endpoints, available in more languages, and with explanations of the underlying flows, see the official [Datadeck Quickstart](https://docs.datadeck.co/docs/introduction).
